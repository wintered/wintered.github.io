title: Enumerative Testing
notitle: false 

description: |
    The enumerative testing framework ET exhaustively enumerates test cases based on a context-free grammar. It will generate small test cases first exploiting the small-scope hypothesis which states that "most bugs in software trigger on small inputs". Testing with small test cases has many unique benefits: tiny bug triggers, bounded guarantees, the ability to measure the evolution of a software.
