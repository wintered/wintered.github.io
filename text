# About me
I'm a PhD student in the AST lab at ETH Zurich, advised by Prof. Zhendong Su.  
My research focus spans * Software Engineering  * PL  * Logic    
Prior to that I did my Bachelors and Masters at the University of Freiburg.
Before, I was doing research in Automated Planning (symbolic AI). 
In 2017, I had an internship with IBM Research where I implemented the k-shortest        
path algorithm K*.
