== Publications in AI Planning  

Prior to my PhD studies at ETH, I did my CS Bachelors and Masters at the 
[http://www.tf.uni-freiburg.de/en University of Freiburg]. During that time, I did 
research in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_planning_and_scheduling Automated Planning] 
(branch of symbolic AI). The following publications resulted from that time:
